   <h3 class="contact">Goals:</h3>
   <p class="generalText">
        The Modular Model Airplane Kit was designed to be fully customizeable, allowing the replacement of wings, tail, fuselage, and various body lengths. This allows for the user to experiment with the different characteristics
        of chord lengths, angles of attack, and other aeronautical principles.
   </p>
   <h3 class="contact">What I learned</h3>
   <p class="generalText">  I learned how to use SolidWorks extensively throughout the entire process. I learned about lofts, surface lofts, infills, and simulations. I have become very familiar with the software and have no problems navigating it now. 
    I also learned more about how airplanes work and what variables within the design process. Using the length of the chord to justify the rest of the aircraft, adjusting the angles of attack, and finding the center of gravity
    are just a few of the very useful things I researched throughout the design process.

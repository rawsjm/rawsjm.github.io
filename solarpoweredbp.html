   <h3 class="contact">Goals:</h3>
<div class="generalText">
    <p>
    The Solar Powered Backpack Unit was designed for the University of Oklahoma Freshman Engineering Experience competition. The goal was to decide on a project that shows the engineering design process and provide proper documentation. My group 
    decided to use this idea becuase it fell within the $50 budget and could be completed within the two-week timeframe. At the competition, our team won runner-up with our only demerit being the absence of the rest of the team. 
    </p>
    <p>  The goal of the project was to create a mobile source of energy to charge mobile devices on the go. The unit would allow the user to attatch it to virtually any backpack for less than $20.

   <h3 class="contact">What I learned</h3>
   <p class="generalText">  I learned how to create and use a Gantt Chart and a selection matrix. I also taught myself to solder, use the Inventor CAD program, and efficiently manage a team of people.

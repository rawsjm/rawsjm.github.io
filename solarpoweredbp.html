    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <div>Create a modular solar powered unit that can be implanted into almost all types of bags/backpacks.</div>
    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <div>With a time limit of two weeks and a budget of $50, the team came up with an idea to effectively provide mobile solar power for an affordable price. THe total unit costs around $20 and takes less than 5 minutes to assemble.</div>
    <h3>Results/Outcomes</h3>
    <div>Overall, the prototype was a success. The solar powered unit was able to passively charge a powerbank to full capacity which in turn charged multiple phones. The main challenge the team faced was the time restraint.</div>

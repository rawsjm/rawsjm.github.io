    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <div>Design a model size airplane with interchangeable parts to customize the flight characteristics. Possibility of implementing horizon-seeking gyroscope to allow automated gliding.</div>
    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <div>Because this is a personal project, there is no budget. However, I have spent around $50 in materials that will cover multiple prototypes. So far, I have created the first iteration of the model and test flown it. The flight was unsuccessful due to the aircraft lacking a grip near the center of gravity.</div>
    <h3>Results/Outcomes</h3>
    <div>So far, the testing and rapid prototyping has been a massive learning experience. I've learned how to operate 3d printers, use Solidworks for advanced methods of CAD design, and learned to perform tests of my own by conducting research on flight tendencies and general material.</div>
